# Projects
A place to dump and share my work. 
Check out the branches. :)

## GPT-Projects

### Character GPT
Problem: Limited exposure to foundational NLP techniques in language models
Approach: Built a character-level GPT from scratch to explore low-level text processing

Tools: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

Results: Developed a functional character-based text generation model

Impact: Strengthened fundamental NLP skills and deepened understanding of GPT architectures

## Neural Net From Scratch

### Generalised Size Neural Net
Problem: Limited understanding of neural networks. Fashion MNIST Classifier

Approach: Implemented a neural network from scratch to bridge theory and practice

Tools: Python, NumPy, Google Colab

Results: Created a working neural network with customizable architecture

Impact: Deepened understanding of neural network fundamentals and backpropagation

## CYOA Engine

### Web-Based CYOA
Problem: Lack of flexible, web-based tools for creating interactive storytelling experiences

Approach: Developed a customizable CYOA engine using modern web technologies

Tools: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON for story structure

Results: Created a versatile engine capable of rendering branching narratives with multimedia elements

Impact: Enabled authors to easily create and share interactive stories, enhancing digital storytelling capabilities

Future: Create a web-based builder so writeres can do the logic visually, AI Generation integration, AI readers

## Decision Tree

### Classifier
Problem: Limited understanding of Decision Tree classification techniques. IRIS dataset

Approach: Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch using object-oriented programming

Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Google Colab

Results: Achieved 93.33% accuracy on the Iris dataset with a max depth of 3

Impact: Gained deeper understanding of decision tree algorithms and their implementation

### Regressor
Problem: Limited understanding of Decision Tree Regression techniques. Airfoil Self-Noise dataset

Approach: Implemented a Decision Tree Regressor from scratch using object-oriented programming

Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Google Colab

Results: Achieved lower RMSE (4.85) compared to baseline mean prediction (7.59) on Airfoil Self-Noise dataset

Impact: Developed a flexible, interpretable regression model. Gained deeper understanding of decision tree algorithms
